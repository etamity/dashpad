export const config = {
    menu: 'Integration Guide',
    icon: 'cui-code'
};

## Integrate your node module

---

### Step 1

Create new folder in `/Users/${username}/documents/dashpad/packages/${your_module}`, and open terminal in your module folder,

`npm init`

to create package.json

and create an `index.js` file in the folder, with below code:

```js
module.exports = function(params) {
    Dashpad.showToast({ message: 'hello form module' });
};
```

`Dashpad` is a global object that we can access dashpad api here.

### Step 2

Create `_dash/config.yml` file, and copy the menu items as below:

```yaml
---
navs:
  - name: My First Module
    icon: icon-speedometer
    isOpen: true
    goto: ui.yml # Your entry ui file
    badge:
        variant: info
        text: NEW
# This settings will display in Dashpad settings in UI
# settings: 
  # username: Joey
  # token: someToken
  # configFile: !import someConfigFile.json
```

Now restart dashpad, we will see the new side menu `My First Module`.

### Step 3

Create `_dash/ui.yaml` file and fill the ui schema:

```yaml
---
Tabs:
    activeTab: 0
    Card:
        label: The first Tab
        Header:
            title: A registration form
        Form:
            Button_notification:
                label: Notification
                onClick: >
                    (e) => {
                        Dashpad.showNotification({
                        title: 'Notification title',
                        message: 'Notification message'
                        });
                        console.log('e', e, 'this', this);

                        Dashpad.run('index.js', {someParams: 'test'}); // calling backend index.js
                    }
                    
```

and now go back to dashpad and click side menu `My First Module`, we will see new we ui has been created.

if click `Notification` button, we will recevie a notification.

### **Note**

If we want to split the js code from yml file into a external js file,  we can just create a js file with exact same name as yaml file, and write logic or function in that js file, Dashpad will preload the code for yaml file usage.

e.g

If `_dash/ui.yaml` file exist already then create another js file call `_dash/ui.js`, so that we can write js code in the file.

> ui.js
``` js
const onTabsMount = () => {
    console.log('Tab Mounted');
}

const onTabsChanged = () => {
    console.log('Tab Changed');
}

console.log('This code is loaded');

```

and then we can call `onTabsMount` in component events, such as `onClick`, `onMount`, `onWillMount` etc.

```yaml
---
Tabs:
    activeTab: 0
    onMount: >
        (e) => {
            onTabsMount();
        }
    onChange: >
        (e) => {
            onTabsChanged();
        }
    Card:
        label: The first Tab

        Header:
            title: A registration form
```

Now check the console, will find message `'This code is loaded'` is there, and then is `'Tab Mounted'`, if change the tab will see the output `'Tab Changed'`.

## Yaml Spliting

You can split yaml file into sub component files, but have to named the file start with `@`, e.g `@filename.yml`, this is for recognising the file as a component, so when we update the component file, it will only re-render main entry file.

e.g

```yaml
Tabs:
    Slot_1: !import components/@Card_dashpad.yml
    Slot_2: !import components/@Card_test.yml
```

`Slot` is a warpper component which doesn't doing anything on appearance, it's useful to organise structure or import sepreated file components.


## This Context

You can access `this` ref in any events, such as `onClick`, `onMount`, `onWillMount` etc. 

```yaml
Container:
    Collapse:
      isOpen: true
      List:
        items:
            - Some example text!
            - another example text!
    Button:
      label: Get Context
      position: left
      brand: linkedin
      onClick: >
        (e) => {
              console.log(this);
              const brand = this.get('brand').value();
              const isOpenProp = this.sibling('Collapse.isOpen');
              const isOpen = isOpenProp.value();
              const newButtonLabel = (isOpen ? 'isOpen' : 'isClosed') 
              this.get('label').set(newButtonLabel+ ' : ' + brand);
              isOpenProp.set(!isOpen);
        }
```

`this.props` refer to the event target itself, we can direct acces target's props object, keypath, type, name etc.

`this.get(key)` refer to the event target itself, we can access target's props object; `this.get(key).value()` will return the value of the prop key.

`this.set(value)` refer to the event target itself, we can set target's props value directly; We also can do chain keypath lookup: `this.parent(key).sibling(key2).set(value)`.

`this.sibling(key)` refer to the event target sibling props object, we can set sibling's props value directly; `this.sibling(key).value()` will return the value of the sibling prop key.

`this.parent(key)` refer to the event target parent props object, we can get parent's props value directly; `this.parent(key).value()` will return the value of the parent prop key.

`this.ref()` refer to the event target instance, we can access target's instance, currently only 'Webview' component has the value return from `ref()`.

**If we want to access parent node's props, the only way to access is to set $vars variables, make it global, as when we want to access cross tree node's state, it suppose to be global state.**

## UI Schema

The yaml ui schema is a tree structure file, when dashpad parse the ui, it alwasy will look for the key name of the object, the format will look like `Type_name`. E.g. `Tabs_mytabs`

Dashpad will parse `Tabs_mytabs` as `Tabs` component and the component name is `Tabs_mytabs`.

**Important** :  `Type_name` the `Type` must start with capital character, so Dashpad will recognise it is a component Type, otherwise will parse it as an attribute.
